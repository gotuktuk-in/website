                    <p>Last updated: February 24th, 2015</p>

                    <p>TukTuk collects information about you when you use our mobile applications, websites, and other online
                        products and services (collectively, the “Services”) and through other interactions and communications you

                        applies to information collected and used by Mad Route Information Technology (referred to herein
                        collectively as “TukTuk” or “we”).</p>

                    <h2 id="scope-and-application">SCOPE AND APPLICATION</h2>

                    <p>This Privacy Statement (“Statement") applies to persons anywhere in the world who use our apps or Services to
                        request transportation, delivery, or other on-demand services (“Users”). This Statement does not apply to
                        information we collect from or about drivers, couriers, partner transportation companies, or any other
                        persons who use the TukTuk platform under license (collectively “Drivers”). If you interact with the
                        Services as both a User and a Driver, the respective privacy statements apply to your different
                        interactions.</p>

                    <h2 id="collection-of-information">COLLECTION OF INFORMATION</h2>

                    <h3 id="information-you-provide-to-us">INFORMATION YOU PROVIDE TO US</h3>

                    <p>We collect information you provide directly to us, such as when you create or modify your account, request
                        on-demand services, contact customer support, or otherwise communicate with us. This information may
                        include: name, email, phone number, postal address, profile picture, payment method, items requested (for
                        delivery services), delivery notes, and other information you choose to provide.</p>

                    <h3 id="information-we-collect-through-your-use-of-our-services">INFORMATION WE COLLECT THROUGH YOUR USE OF OUR
                        SERVICES</h3>

                    <p>When you use our Services, we collect information about you in the following general categories:</p>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>Location Information</strong>: When you use the Services for transportation or delivery, we
                            collect precise location data about the trip from the TukTuk app used by the Driver. If you permit the
                            TukTuk app to access location services through the permission system used by your mobile operating
                            system (“platform”), we may also collect the precise location of your device when the app is running in
                            the foreground or background. We may also derive your approximate location from your IP address.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Contacts Information</strong>: If you permit the TukTuk app to access the address book on your
                            device through the permission system used by your mobile platform, we may access and store names and
                            contact information from your address book to facilitate social interactions through our Services and
                            for other purposes described in this Statement or at the time of consent or collection.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Transaction Information</strong>: We collect transaction details related to your use of our
                            Services, including the type of service requested, date and time the service was provided, amount
                            charged, distance traveled, and other related transaction details. Additionally, if someone uses your
                            promo code, we may associate your name with that person.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Usage and Preference Information</strong>: We collect information about how you and site
                            visitors interact with our Services, preferences expressed, and settings chosen. In some cases we do
                            this through the use of cookies, pixel tags, and similar technologies that create and maintain unique
                            identifiers.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Device Information</strong>: We may collect information about your mobile device, including, for
                            example, the hardware model, operating system and version, software and file names and verions,
                            preferred language, unique device identifier, advertising identifiers, serial number, device motion
                            information, and mobile network information.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Call and SMS Data</strong>: Our Services facilitate communications between Users and Drivers. In
                            connection with facilitating this service, we receive call data, including the date and time of the call
                            or SMS message, the parties’ phone numbers, and the content of the SMS message.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Log Information</strong>: When you interact with the Services, we collect server logs, which may
                            include information like device IP address, access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app
                            crashes and other system activity, type of browser, and the third-party site or service you were using
                            before interacting with our Services.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                    <h3 id="important-information-about-platform-permissions">IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PLATFORM PERMISSIONS</h3>

                    <p>Most mobile platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access
                        without your consent. And these platforms have different permission systems for obtaining your consent. The
                        iOS platform will alert you the first time the TukTuk app wants permission to access certain types of data
                        and will let you consent (or not consent) to that request. Android devices will notify you of the
                        permissions that the TukTuk app seeks before you first use the app, and your use of the app constitutes your
                        consent. </p>

                    <h3 id="information-we-collect-from-other-sources">INFORMATION WE COLLECT FROM OTHER SOURCES</h3>

                    <p>We may also receive information from other sources and combine that with information we collect through our
                        Services. For example:
                        - If you choose to link, create, or log in to your TukTuk account with a payment provider (e.g., Citrus
                        Wallet) or social media service (e.g., Facebook), or if you engage with a separate app or website that uses
                        our API (or whose API we use), we may receive information about you or your connections from that site or
                        app.
                        - If your employer uses one of our enterprise solutions, such as TukTuk for Business, we may receive
                        information about you from your employer.
                        - When you request on demand services, our Drivers may provide us with a User rating after providing
                        services to you.
                        - If you also interact with our Services in another capacity, for instance as a Driver or user of other apps
                        we provide, we may combine or associate that information with information we have collected from you in your
                        capacity as a User or rider.</p>

                    <h3 id="use-of-information">USE OF INFORMATION</h3>

                        Where this is the case, we will take appropriate measures to protect your personal information in accordance
                        with this Statement. </p>

                    <p>The Services may integrate with social sharing features and other related tools which let you share actions
                        you take on our Services with other apps, sites, or media, and vice versa. Your use of such features enables
                        the sharing of information with your friends or the public, depending on the settings you establish with the
                        social sharing service. Please refer to the privacy policies of those social sharing services for more
                        information about how they handle the data you provide to or share through them.</p>

                        OTHERS</h2>

                    <p>We may allow others to provide audience measurement and analytics services for us, to serve advertisements on
                        our behalf across the Internet, and to track and report on the performance of those advertisements. These
                        entities may use cookies, web beacons, SDKs, and other technologies to identify your device when you visit
                        our site and use our Services, as well as when you visit other online sites and services.</p>

                    <h2 id="your-choices">YOUR CHOICES</h2>

                    <h3 id="account-information">ACCOUNT INFORMATION</h3>

                    <p>You may correct your account information at any time by logging into your online or in-app account. If you
                        wish to cancel your account, please email us at support@TukTuk.com. Please note that in some cases we may
                        retain certain information about you as required by law, or for legitimate business purposes to the extent
                        permitted by law. For instance, if you have a standing credit or debt on your account, or if we believe you
                        have committed fraud or violated our Terms, we may seek to resolve the issue before deleting your
                        information.</p>

                    <h3 id="access-rights">ACCESS RIGHTS</h3>

                    <p>TukTuk will comply with individual’s requests regarding access, correction, and/or deletion of the personal
                        data it stores in accordance with applicable law.</p>

                    <h3 id="location-information">LOCATION INFORMATION</h3>

                    <p>We request permission for our app’s collection of precise location from your device per the permission system
                        used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this information, you can
                        later disable it by changing the location settings on your mobile device. However, this will limit your
                        ability to use certain features of our Services. Additionally, disabling our app’s collection of precise
                        location from your device will not limit our ability to collect your trip location information from a
                        Driver's device nor our ability to derive approximate location from your IP address.</p>

                    <h3 id="contact-information">CONTACT INFORMATION</h3>

                    <p>We may also seek permission for our app’s collection and syncing of contact information from your device per
                        the permission system used by your mobile operating system. If you initially permit the collection of this
                        information, iOS users can later disable it by changing the contacts settings on your mobile device. The
                        Android platform does not provide such a setting.</p>

                    <h3 id="promotional-communications">PROMOTIONAL COMMUNICATIONS</h3>

                    <p>You may opt out of receiving promotional messages from us by following the instructions in those messages. If
                        you opt out, we may still send you non-promotional communications, such as those about your account, about
                        Services you have requested, or our ongoing business relations.</p>

                    <h3 id="cookies-and-advertising">COOKIES AND ADVERTISING</h3>

                    <p>Please refer to our Cookie Statement for more information about your choices around cookies and related

                    <p>We may change this Statement from time to time. If we make significant changes in the way we treat your
