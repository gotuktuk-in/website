                            <h4 id="user-provided-content">USER PROVIDED CONTENT</h4>

Any User Content provided by you remains your property. However, by providing User Content to TukTuk, you grant TukTuk a worldwide, perpetual, irrevocable, transferrable, royalty-free license, with the right to sublicense, to use, copy, modify, create derivative works of, distribute, publicly display, publicly perform, and otherwise exploit in any manner such User Content in all formats and distribution channels now known or hereafter devised (including in connection with the Services and TukTuk’s business and on third-party sites and services), without further notice to or consent from you, and without the requirement of payment to you or any other person or entity.</p>
                            <p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you either are the sole and exclusive owner of all User Content or you have all rights, licenses, consents and releases necessary to grant TukTuk the license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor TukTuk’s use of the User Content as permitted herein will infringe, misappropriate or violate a third party’s intellectual property or proprietary rights, or rights of publicity or privacy, or result in the violation of any applicable law or regulation.</p>
                            <p>You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene, pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by TukTuk in its sole discretion, whether or not such material may be protected by law. TukTuk may, but shall not be obligated to, review, monitor, or remove User Content, at TukTuk’s sole discretion and at any time and for any reason, without notice to you.</p>
                            <h4 id="network-access-and-devices">NETWORK ACCESS AND DEVICES</h4>
                            <p>You are responsible for obtaining the data network access necessary to use the Services. Your mobile network’s data and messaging rates and fees may apply if you access or use the Services from a wireless-enabled device and you shall be responsible for such rates and fees. You are responsible for acquiring and updating compatible hardware or devices necessary to access and use the Services and Applications and any updates thereto. TukTuk does not guarantee that the Services, or any portion thereof, will function on any particular hardware or devices. In addition, the Services may be subject to malfunctions and delays inherent in the use of the Internet and electronic communications.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>PAYMENT</p>
                            <p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods you receive from a Third Party Provider (“Charges ”). After you have received services or goods obtained through your use of the Service, TukTuk will facilitate your payment of the applicable Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider as such Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless otherwise determined by TukTuk. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time you receive such services or goods. TukTuk will respond accordingly to any request from a Third Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.</p>
                            <p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by TukTuk using the preferred payment method designated in your Account, after which TukTuk will send you a receipt by email. If your primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to be charged, you agree that TukTuk may, as the Third Party Provider’s limited payment collection agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
                            <p>As between you and TukTuk, TukTuk reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in TukTuk’s sole discretion. Further, you acknowledge and agree that Charges applicable in certain geographical areas may increase substantially during times of high demand. TukTuk will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. TukTuk may from time to time provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such Third Party Provider’s arrival, in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.</p>
                            <p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services or goods provided. Except with respect to taxicab transportation services requested through the Application, TukTuk does not designate any portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the Third Party Provider. Any representation by TukTuk (on TukTuk’s website, in the Application, or in TukTuk’s marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is “voluntary,” “not required,” and/or “included” in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not intended to suggest that TukTuk provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above, to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide additional payment as a gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third Party Provider.</p>
                            <h4 id="repair-or-cleaning-fees">REPAIR OR CLEANING FEES</h4>
                            <p>You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Third Party Provider vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in excess of normal “wear and tear” damages and necessary cleaning (“Repair or Cleaning”). In the event that a Third Party Provider reports the need for Repair or Cleaning, and such Repair or Cleaning request is verified by TukTuk in TukTuk’s reasonable discretion, TukTuk reserves the right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on behalf of the Third Party Provider using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts will be transferred by TukTuk to the applicable Third Party Provider and are non-refundable.</p>
                        </li>

TUKTUK DOES NOT GUARANTEE THE QUALITY, SUITABILITY, SAFETY OR ABILITY OF THIRD PARTY PROVIDERS. YOU AGREE THAT THE ENTIRE RISK ARISING OUT OF YOUR USE OF THE SERVICES, AND ANY SERVICE OR GOOD REQUESTED IN CONNECTION THEREWITH, REMAINS SOLELY WITH YOU, TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED UNDER APPLICABLE LAW.</p>
